# Notes For Translators:

- Do not merge different information texts. For example: do not translate ```Connected - SSID``` 
as ```Connected SSID```. The text contains two different information. 

- Be careful about uppercase and lowercase letters.

- Be careful about ```:``` characters. You can change it if a different character is used in your language.

- Do not forget to translate the text in the ```.desktop``` file. The text in this file is used for application 
shortcut in the operation system menus (start menu, etc.). For example: application name, description, etc.
The ```.desktop``` file is in the ```integration``` folder.
